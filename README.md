* This is **a contact management application for primary and secondary school teachers**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a tool for organizing and managing student, parent, and school administration contacts

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ClassHive_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **well-structured** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly large.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* _ClassHive_ was developed to help teachers keep track of their professional contacts and related tasks efficiently.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ClassHive](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/index.html)**.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.

***This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).***
